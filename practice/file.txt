1;margin collapse
margin collapse is for bottom and top; not for felt and right

2;flex skrink
The flex-shrink property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.

Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-shrink property has no effect.
